# COMP-401-Assignments
Series of Assignments that I did in COMP 401.

In assignment 8 we played around with Java Swing in order to create a UI that would manipulate a photo.

The PixelInspectorTest.java when run opens up a picture of our professor and where ever you click on the picture it will 
give you information regarding that pixel such as x and y and the rgb values.

The ImageAdjusterTest.java when run opens the same picture of our professor but this time it has sliders under it that adjust
the blur, brightness and saturation of the picture.

The FramePuzzleTest.java when jumbles up the picture as you move the green square with your arrow keys. Your task is to reorder the 
picture.

All these files are in the src folder.
